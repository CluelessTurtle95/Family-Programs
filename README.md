# Family Programs For You

## Inspiration
While website like Google maps do provide user reviews they aren't very specific when it comes to real content. Also, there is no way to search among all reviews to match the specific facilities you want your child to have.

## What it does
Our App is a platform where parents and guardians can submit real meaningful reviews about child development centres and users can use this to search for the best program for their child.

## How we built it
The frontend was made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript while the backend was done in python.
